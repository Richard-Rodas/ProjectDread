# Project Dread

## Description
Forsakened is a chilling first-person horror game that plunges players into dark, twisted landscapes where an ancient evil lurks just beyond sight. Navigate abandoned villages hidden deep within shadowy forests, unravel the secrets of a haunted high school, or brave the endless maze of a sinister labyrinth. Each map brings a unique set of horrors, with clues scattered throughout to help you survive and uncover the mystery. But bewareâ€”something relentless follows, watching your every move, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Will you escape, or will you be Forsaken?
